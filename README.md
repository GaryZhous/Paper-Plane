# Paper-Plane
 Project for Hack the North 2023. A paper-made plane that can glide through the air! It is controlled by a server made in Node.js and React.js on my laptop, which also monitors the status of the plane through the use of an accelerometer, and can change the speed remotely through HTTP protocols and API calls from the ESP32 on the back of the plane.
